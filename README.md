## **Verticals**  
The following core verticals define our approach to achieving our mission. Each vertical represents a pillar of gameplay that contributes to the playerâ€™s ability to craft their own experience.  

### **1. Skills** *(Top Priority)*  
**Description:**  
Skills are the foundation of the player's journey. They provide avenues for progression, achievement, and specialization. Players can train skills, level up, and unlock new abilities or rewards. Skills define a player's role, whether as an artisan, gatherer, or supplier, and serve as the backbone of their in-game identity.

**Goals:**

### **2. Player vs. Monsters (PvM)**  
**Description:**  
PvM revolves around drop farming, emphasizing the thrill of acquiring valuable rewards through combat. While the combat system is simple, the focus is on creating engaging and rewarding drop mechanics to sustain player interest with minimal difficulty.

**Goals:**  
- Design drop systems that are engaging and rewarding, encouraging repeat play.  
- Introduce a variety of loot to cater to different player goals and preferences.  
- Create scalable content that accommodates players with diverse skill levels and time commitments.

### **3. Community**  
**Description:**  
The community vertical provides opportunities for players to interact with each other, share experiences, and leave their mark on the game world. From social spaces to customizable experiences and prestigious achievements, the community vertical fosters a sense of belonging and recognition.

**Goals:**  
- Build systems that encourage player-to-player interaction and cooperation.  
- Enable meaningful customization of the player experience.  
- Offer achievements and rewards that allow players to showcase their accomplishments.

### **4. Player vs. Player (PvP)**  
**Description:**  
PvP is the least impactful vertical, offering minimal standalone content. Its primary purpose is to integrate with other verticals, enhancing their value while providing opportunities for players who enjoy PvP. PvP serves as a complementary experience, adding competitive elements and dynamic interactions to other gameplay systems.

**Goals:**  
- Integrate PvP into other verticals, such as PvM and community, to create richer gameplay opportunities.  
- Provide optional PvP experiences that enhance rewards in other activities.
